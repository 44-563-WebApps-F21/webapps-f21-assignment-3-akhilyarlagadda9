        It is not cheap or easy to reach, but this isolated paradise between the <b>Arabian and Laccadive seas</b> is the
        personification of a dreamy tropical vacation. In this <b>South Asian</b> destination, which is made up of more than
        <b>1,000 islands</b>, thatched-roof bungalows sit above crystal-clear aquamarine waters, providing easy water access
        and a romantic atmosphere.
